# Wolf-Encryption-Program
Encrypts or Decrypts strings either with or without a password. Branded "Wolf Encryption" by me. Use it to create secret messages that only people who have access to this program will be able to crack.

There is no length limit for data or passwords, and most characters are supported (All english letters upper and lower, all numbers, and all special characters that you can achieve by pressing shift-key. No alt-key characters.

This code is open source, public and free for you to use. But if you have ANY moral standards (Or value any future communication with me), please follow these guidelines before using my code:

If you use my code you must provide attribution by way of my first and last name(Zach Hofmeister), blog(http://wolfspalace.blogspot.com/), and Github link(https://github.com/ZachHofmeister). This information must be present as a comment near the code you borrowed yourself, and anywhere you post any files containing my code (Pastebin, Your Github repository, your Website, anywhere someone else will see my work.)

I would appreciate if you would contact me telling me that you are going to use my code, you are going to attribute me, and what you are going to use it for, just for my intrest (Unless it is illegal, then the police will be called...). Also it would be cool to get a link to what you used if for, again just for my intrest.

Thank you for reading this and respecting my simple requests. I attribute everything that I use, and I appreciate it when people do the same for me. Non-attributors, may you burn in hell.
